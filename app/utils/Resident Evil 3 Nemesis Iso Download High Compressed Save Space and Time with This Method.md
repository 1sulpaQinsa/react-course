## Gameplay Tips for Resident Evil 3 Nemesis
 
Resident Evil 3 Nemesis is not an easy game, especially if you play on Hard mode. You will face many challenges and dangers, such as zombies, hunters, spiders, worms, and of course, the Nemesis himself. Here are some tips to help you survive and enjoy this classic game:

- Save your ammo and health items. They are scarce and valuable, so don't waste them on enemies that you can avoid or dodge. Use your knife or handgun for weaker foes, and save your shotgun or grenade launcher for tougher ones. Also, try to combine herbs to make more potent healing items.
- Use the environment to your advantage. There are many objects and items that you can use to damage or distract your enemies, such as explosive barrels, generators, fire hydrants, oil drums, etc. You can also use doors and windows to escape or block enemies.
- Explore every area and check every corner. You never know what you might find, such as ammo, health items, files, puzzles, keys, etc. Some items are hidden or require a specific action to obtain them, so be thorough and observant.
- Make good use of the item box and the save room. The item box allows you to store and retrieve items that you don't need at the moment. The save room allows you to save your progress using an ink ribbon. Both are safe places where you can rest and plan your next move.
- Be prepared for the Nemesis. He is the main antagonist of the game and he will chase you throughout the game. He is fast, strong, and relentless. He can also use weapons such as a rocket launcher or a tentacle whip. You can either fight him or run away from him. Fighting him will reward you with special items, but it will also consume your resources and time. Running away from him will save you trouble, but it will also make him more aggressive and unpredictable.

Resident Evil 3 Nemesis is a thrilling and challenging game that will test your skills and nerves. Follow these tips and you will have a better chance of surviving this nightmare.
