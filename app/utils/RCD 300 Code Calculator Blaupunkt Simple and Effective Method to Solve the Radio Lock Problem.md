The multiplayer modes of COD Black Ops 1 are largely based on what was established by Modern Warfare, but with some twists that make them unique and fun[^2^]. Here are some of the most popular modes:
 
- **Team Deathmatch:** The classic mode where two teams of up to six players each try to kill each other and score points. The team with the most points at the end of the match wins.
- **Free-for-All:** A solo mode where every player is on their own and tries to kill as many enemies as possible. The player with the most kills at the end of the match wins.
- **Capture the Flag:** A mode where two teams of up to six players each try to capture the enemy's flag and return it to their base, while defending their own flag from being stolen. The team with the most captures at the end of the match wins.
- **Domination:** A mode where two teams of up to six players each try to control three flags on the map. The team that controls more flags earns more points over time. The team with the most points at the end of the match wins.
- **Search and Destroy:** A mode where two teams of up to six players each take turns attacking and defending two bomb sites on the map. The attacking team tries to plant a bomb at one of the sites and detonate it, while the defending team tries to prevent them or defuse the bomb. The team that completes their objective or eliminates all enemies wins.
- **Zombie Mode:** A co-op mode where up to four players team up to survive waves of zombies and other creatures. The players can buy weapons, perks, and upgrades with points earned from killing zombies. The mode has several maps with different settings and stories.
- **Wager Mode:** A mode where up to six players bet their in-game currency on their performance in four sub-modes: One in the Chamber, Gun Game, Sticks and Stones, and Sharpshooter. The top three players win a share of the pot, while the rest lose their bet.
